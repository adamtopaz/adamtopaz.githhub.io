## About

I am a mathematician working primarily in algebra and arithmetic / algebraic geometry.
My research interests mostly revolve around Galois theory, with an emphasis on anabelian geometry and other related topics in arithmetic/algebraic geometry.
I am also interested in various other topics, such as algebraic cycles, Hodge theory (Archimedean and p-adic), valuation theory, differential Galois theory, model theory of fields, etc.

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the department of [Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://www.ualberta.ca/mathematical-and-statistical-sciences/index.html) at the University of Alberta.
I previously held postdoctoral positions at Oxford and Berkeley.
I completed my Ph.D. in 2013 at the University of Pennsylvania.
